# 3D Solar System

A simple, interactive 3D solar system built with web technologies.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS:** For styling the page.
*   **JavaScript:** For the logic and interactivity.
*   **Three.js:** A 3D graphics library for creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.

## Milestones

Here are three clear milestones to guide the development of the 3D solar system:

### Milestone 1: Basic Scene Setup

*   [x] Create the basic HTML file structure.
*   [x] Set up a Three.js scene with a camera and renderer.
*   [x] Add a light source to the scene.
*   [x] Create and add the Sun to the scene.
*   [x] Implement a basic animation loop.

### Milestone 2: Adding Planets

*   [x] Create spheres for each planet in our solar system.
*   [x] Apply textures to the Sun and planets using image files.
*   [x] Position the planets at their relative distances from the Sun.
*   [x] Add basic rotation to the Sun and planets.

### Milestone 3: Implementing Orbits

*   [x] Create orbital paths for each planet.
*   [x] Animate the planets moving along their orbital paths.
*   [x] Add labels for each planet.
*   [x] Implement basic camera controls to navigate the scene.
